"""
Pre-commit hook to check for a copyright notice at the start of each file.

The copyright notice must start on the first line of the file (or the second line,
if the first line is a shebang), and must exactly match the template file specified.

Exits with code 1 if any checked file does not have the copyright notice, printing
the names of offending files to standard error. Exits silently with code 0 if all
checked files have the notice.

Optionally, with the `--unsafe-fix` argument, this script can attempt to
automatically insert the copyright notice at the top of files that are missing it.
The method that this script tries is naive, though, and may cause unexpected issues,
so be sure to check on any changes it makes! Using this argument when using this
script as a pre-commit hook is not recommended.

If you want to change the copyright notice template, a multi-file find-and-replace
tool is likely your best bet, rather than trying to use `--unsafe-fix`.
