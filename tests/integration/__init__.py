Integration tests to verify functionality of the coreax library.

Tests for end-to-end runs in typical applications of the coreax library. These should be
called individually or serially, e.g. via a bash script, to avoid errors arising from
Jax tracers being reused by the parent process.

To elaborate: where multiple unit tests are run from a parent process, Jax is likely to
re-use compiled tracers if present. This can result in errors where data types within
the tracers differ (as they are likely to do in integration tests). Unfortunately, this
doesn't seem to be rectified by multiprocessing, so a simple method to run a batch of
tests from separate parent processes is to run or loop over them individually.
