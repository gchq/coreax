Recombination solvers.

Take a dataset :math:`\{(x_i, w_i)\}_{i=1}^n`, where each node :math:`x_i \in \Omega`
is paired with a weight :math:`w_i \in \mathbb{R} \ge 0`, and the sum of all weights
is one, :math:`\sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1` (a strict requirement for a probability measure).

.. note::
    Given any weighted dataset, we can use normalisation to satisfy the sum to
    one condition, providing :math:`\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \neq 0`.

Combined with :math:`m-1` test-functions :math:`\Phi^\prime = \{\phi_i\}_{i=1}^{m-1}`,
where :math:`\phi_i \colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}`, that parametrise a set of :math:`m`
test-functions :math:`\Phi = \{x \mapsto 1\} \cup \Phi^\prime`, there exists a dataset
push-forward measure :math:`\mu_n := \Phi_* \nu_n`.

A recombination solver attempts to find a reduced measure (a coresubset)
:math:`\hat{\mu}_{m^\prime}`, which is given as a basic-feasible solution (BFS) to the
following linear-programming problem (with trivial objective)

.. math::
    \begin{align}
        \mathbf{Y} \mathbf{\hat{w}} &= \text{CoM}(\mu_n),\\
        \mathbf{\hat{w}} &\ge 0,
    \end{align}

where the system variables and "centre-of-mass" are defined as

.. math::
    \begin{gather}
    \mathbf{Y} := \left[\Phi(x_1), \dots, \Phi(x_n)\right] \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n},\
    \mathbf{\hat{w}} \in \mathbb{R}^n \ge 0,\\
    \text{CoM}(\mu_n) := \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \Phi(x_i)
            = \left[ \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \phi_j(x_i) \right]_{j=1}^m \in \mathbb{R}^m.\\
    \end{gather}

.. note::
    The source dataset is, by definition, a solution to the linear-program that is not
    necessarily a BFS. Hence, one may consider the fundamental problem of recombination
    as that of finding a BFS given a solution that is not a BFS.

Basic feasible solutions to the linear-program above are of the form
:math:`\mathbf{\hat{w}} = \{\hat{w}_1, \dots, \hat{w}_{m^\prime}, \mathbf{0}\}`; I.E.
BFSs are feasible solutions with :math:`n-m^\prime` weights equal to zero. Given a BFS,
the reduced measure (the coresubset) can be constructed by explicitly removing the nodes
associated with each zero valued (implicitly removed) weight

.. math::
    \begin{gather}
    \hat{\nu}_{m^\prime} = \sum_{i \in I} \hat{w_i} \delta_{x_i},\\
    I = \{i \mid \hat{w_i} \neq 0\, \forall i \in \{1, \dots, n\}\}.
    \end{gather}

Due to Tchakaloff's theorem :cite:`tchakaloff1957,bayer2006tchakaloff`, which follows
from Caratheodory's convex hull theorem :cite:`caratheodory1907,loera2018caratheodory`,
we know there always exists a basic-feasible solution to the linear-program, with at
most :math:`m^\prime = \text{dim}(\text{span}(\Phi))` non-zero weights. Hence, we have
an upper bound on the size of a coresubset, controlled by the choice of test-functions.

.. note::
    A basic feasible solution (coresubset produced by recombination) is non-unique. In
    fact, there exists :math:`\binom{n}{m^\prime}` basic feasible solutions
    (coresubsets) for the described linear-program. In the context of Coreax, this means
    that a :class:`RecombinationSolver` is unlikely to ever be truly invariant to the
    presence of padding (see :class:`~coreax.solvers.PaddingInvariantSolver`). I.E. the
    padded problem may have an equivalent, but different BFS than the unpadded problem.

Canonically, recombination is used for reducing the support of a quadrature/cubature
measure, against which integration of any function :math:`f \in \text{span}(\Phi)`
is identical to integration against a "target" (potentially continuous) measure
:math:`\mu`.

    Make zero-weighted nodes co-linear with the maximum weighted node.

    Due to the static shape requirements imposed by JAX, we implicitly remove nodes by

    the zero-weighted nodes still exist in the node matrix, they influence the SVD and

    We ameliorate this problem by setting the zero-weighted nodes equal (co-linear) to
    the largest weighted node (an arbitrary but consistent choice). Because the nodes
    are now co-linear to each other and the largest weighted node, we know that at least
    all but one of them can be safely eliminated by the recombination procedure. Thus,
    the nodes become effectively "invisible" to the elimination procedure.

    The only caveat is that we don't know which of the equal nodes will be retained post
    elimination. To handle this, we keep an index (reference) from the zero-weighted
    nodes to the largest weighted node, and we redistribute the largest weight equally

class TreeRecombination(RecombinationSolver[Data, None]):
    r"""
    Tree recombination based coresubset solver.

    Based on Algorithm 7 Chapter 3.3 of :cite:`tchernychova2016recombination`, which
    is an order of magnitude more efficient than Algorithm 5 in Chapter 3.2, originally
    introduced in :cite:`litterer2012recombination`.

    The time complexity is of order :math:`\mathcal{O}(\log_2(\frac{n}{c_r m}) m^3)`,
    where :math`c_r` is the `tree_reduction_factor`. The time complexity can be
    equivalently expressed as :math:`\mathcal{O}(m^3)`, using the same arguments as used
    in :class:`CaratheodoryRecombination`.

    .. note::
        As the ratio of :math:`n / m` grows, the constant factor for the time complexity
        of :class:`TreeRecombination` increases at a logarithmic rate, rather than at a
        quadratic rate for plain :class:`CaratheodoryRecombination`. Hence, in general,
        we would expect :class:`TreeRecombination` to be the more efficient choice for
        all but the smallest values of :math:`n / m`.

    :param test_functions: the map :math:`\Phi^\prime = \{ \phi_1, \dots, \phi_{M-1} \}`
        where each :math:`\phi_i \colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}` represents a linearly
        independent test-function; a value of :data:`None` implies the identity function
        (necessarily assuming :math:`\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{M-1}`)
    :param mode: 'implicit-explicit' explicitly removes :math:`n - m` points, yielding
        a coreset of size :math:`m`, with :math:`m - m^\prime` zero-weighted (implicitly
        removed) points; 'implicit' explicitly removes no points, yielding a coreset of
        size :math:`n` with :math:`n - m^\prime` zero-weighted (implicitly removed)
        points; 'explicit' explicitly removes :math:`n - m^\prime` points, yielding a
        coreset of size :math:`m^\prime`, but unlike the other methods is not JIT
        compatible as the coreset size :math:`m^\prime` is unknown at compile time.
    :param rcond: a relative condition number; any singular value :math:`s` below the
        threshold :math:`\text{rcond} * \text{max}(s)` is treated as equal to zero; if
        :code:`rcond is None`, it defaults to `floating point eps * max(n, d)`
    :param tree_reduction_factor: The factor by which each tree reduction step reduces
        the number of non-zero points; the remaining number of non-zero nodes, after
        performing recombination, is equal to `n_nodes / tree_reduction_factor`;

            on these centroids (rather than on the full dataset), with every node in the
            eliminated centroids' cluster being implicitly removed (given zero-weight).
