    r"""
    Calculate coreset of a given number of points using scalable reduction on blocks.

    Uses a :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KDTree` or :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.BallTree` to
    partition the original data into patches. Upon each of these a coreset of size
    ``base_solver.coreset_size`` is calculated. These coresets are concatenated to
    produce a larger coreset covering the whole of the original data, which has size
    greater than ``coreset_size``. This coreset is now treated as the original data and
    reduced recursively until its size is equal to ``base_solver.coreset_size``.

    There is some intricate set-up:

    #.  ``base_solver.coreset_size`` must be less than ``leaf_size``.
    #.  Zero weighted and valued padding will be used to ensure each partition has the
        same size if ``len(dataset)`` is not an integer multiple of ``leaf_size``

    Let :math:`n_k` be the number of points after each recursion with :math:`n_0` equal
    to the size of the original data. Then, each recursion reduces the size of the
    coreset such that

    .. math::

        n_k <= \frac{n_{k - 1}}{\texttt{leaf_size}} \texttt{coreset_size},

    so

    .. math::

        n_k <= \left( \frac{\texttt{coreset_size}}{\texttt{leaf_size}} \right)^k n_0.

    Thus, the number of iterations required is roughly (find :math:`k` when
    :math:`n_k =` ``base_solver.coreset_size``)

    .. math::

        \frac{
            \log{\texttt{coreset_size}} - \log{\left(\text{original data size}\right)}
        }{
            \log{\texttt{coreset_size}} - \log{\texttt{leaf_size}}
        } .
