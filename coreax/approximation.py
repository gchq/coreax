Classes and associated functionality to approximate kernel matrix row sum mean.

When a dataset is very large, computing the mean distance between a given point
and all other points can be time-consuming. For many approaches in this library, such an
operation would need to be done for all data points in the dataset. To reduce the
computational demand of this, the quantity can instead be approximated by various
methods.

For a concrete example of the (true) kernel matrix row sum mean, consider the data:

.. math::

    x = [ [0.0, 0.0], [0.5, 0.5], [1.0, 0.0], [-1.0, 0.0] ]

and a :class:`~coreax.kernel.SquaredExponentialKernel` which is defined as
:math:`k(x,y) = \text{output_scale}\exp(-||x-y||^2/2 * \text{length_scale}^2)`.
For simplicity, we set ``length_scale`` to :math:`1.0/np.sqrt(2)`
and ``output_scale`` to 1.0.

For a single row (data point), the kernel matrix row sum mean is computed by
applying the kernel to this data record and all other data records. We then sum
the results and divide by the number of data points. The first
data point ``[0, 0]`` in the data considered here therefore gives a result of:

.. math::

      (1/4) * (
      exp(-((0.0 - 0.0)^2 + (0.0 - 0.0)^2)) +
      exp(-((0.0 - 0.5)^2 + (0.0 - 0.5)^2)) +
      exp(-((0.0 - 1.0)^2 + (0.0 - 0.0)^2)) +
      exp(-((0.0 - -1.0)^2 + (0.0 - 0.0)^2))
      )

which evaluates to 0.5855723855138795.

We can repeat the above but considering each data-point in ``x`` in turn and
attain an array with one element for each data point in the original dataset. For this
example data, the final result would be:

.. math::

    [
        0.5855723855138795,
        0.5737865795122914,
        0.4981814349432025,
        0.3670700196710188
    ]

The approximations within this module attempt to accurately estimate the result of the
above calculations, without having to perform as many evaluations of the kernel. All
approximators in this module implement the base class :class:`KernelMeanApproximator`.
