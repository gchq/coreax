This module contains classes for methods of constructing coresets.

Coresets are a type of data reduction, so these inherit from
:class:`~coreax.reduction.DataReduction`. The aim is to select a samll set of indices
that represent the key features of a larger dataset.

The abstract base class is :class:`Coreset`. Concrete implementations are:

*   :class:`KernelHerding` defines the kernel herding method for both regular and Stein
    kernels.
*   :class:`RandomSample` selects points for the coreset using random sampling. It is
    typically only used for benchmarking against other coreset methods.
