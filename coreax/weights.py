Classes and associated functionality to optimise weighted representations of data.

Several aspects of this codebase take a :math:`n \times d` dataset and generate an
alternative representation of it, for example a coreset. The quality of this alternative
representation in approximating the original dataset can be assessed using some metric
of interest, for example see :class:`~coreax.metrics.Metric`.

One can improve the quality of the representation generated by weighting the individual
elements of it. These weights are determined by optimising the metric of interest, which
compares the original :math:`n \times d` dataset and the generated representation of it.

This module provides functionality to calculate such weights, through various methods.
All methods implement :class:`WeightsOptimiser` and must have a
:meth:`~WeightsOptimiser.solve` method that, given two datasets, returns an array of
weights such that a metric of interest is optimised when these weights are applied to
the dataset.
