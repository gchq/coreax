r"""
Classes and associated functionality to compute metrics assessing similarity of inputs.

Large parts of this codebase consider the generic problem of taking a
:math:`n \times d` dataset and creating an alternative representation of it in some way.
Having attained an alternative representation, we can then assess the quality of this
representation using some appropriate metric. Such metrics are implemented within this
module, all of which implement :class:`Metric`.

    Definition and calculation of the (weighted) maximum mean discrepancy metric.

    For a dataset :math:`\mathcal{D}_1` of ``n`` points in ``d`` dimensions, and
    another dataset :math:`\mathcal{D}_2` of ``m`` points in ``d`` dimensions, the
    (weighted) maximum mean discrepancy is given by:

    .. math::
        \text{MMD}^2(\mathcal{D}_1,\mathcal{D}_2) = \mathbb{E}(k(\mathcal{D}_1,
        \mathcal{D}_1)) + \mathbb{E}(k(\mathcal{D}_2,\mathcal{D}_2))
        - 2\mathbb{E}(k(\mathcal{D}_1,\mathcal{D}_2))

    where :math:`k` is the selected kernel, and the expectation is with respect to the
    normalized data weights.

    Common uses of MMD include comparing a reduced representation of a dataset to the
    original dataset, comparing different original datasets to one another, or
    comparing reduced representations of different original datasets to one another.
