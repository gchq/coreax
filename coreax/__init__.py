Coreax library for generation of compressed representations of datasets.

The coreax library contains code to address the following generic problem. Given an
:math:`n \times d` dataset, generate a :math:`m \times d` dataset, with :math:`m << n`
such that the generated dataset contains as much of the information from the original
dataset as possible. The generated dataset is often called a coreset.

To improve speed of computational, various parts of the codebase utilise JAX's
implementation of JIT compilation. One example of this can be seen in
:meth:`coreax.kernel.Kernel.compute`. Whilst this significantly increases performance of
the code, care needs to be taken when using JIT decorators on class methods. Whenever
such an instance occurs, one must also define the methods :meth:`_tree_unflatten` and
:meth:`_tree_flatten`, or the JIT functionality on the class will not function. These
methods handle flattening and constructing the pytree objects that JAX depends on for
computations.

Inside :meth:`_tree_unflatten`, one must define arrays & dynamic values (children)
and auxiliary data (static values) of the class. Inside :meth:`_tree_flatten`, one
can pass these children and auxiliary data to the class. See
:class:`coreax.kernel.Kernel` and children of this object for example implementations of
this.

Further details on pytrees in JAX can be found at
https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html and
https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-to-use-jit-with-methods.

Performance tests are implemented in tests/performance/ that verify the code is in-fact
faster when using JIT compilation, and should be updated as new JIT functionality is
included in the codebase.
