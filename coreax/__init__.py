Coreax library for generation of compressed representations of datasets.

The coreax library contains code to address the following generic problem. Given an
:math:`n \times d` dataset, generate a :math:`m \times d` dataset, with :math:`m << n`
such that the generated dataset contains as much of the information from the original
dataset as possible. The generated dataset is often called a coreset.
