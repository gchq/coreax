Classes and associated functionality to use kernel functions.

A kernel is a non-negative, real-valued integrable function that can take two inputs,
``x`` and ``y``, and returns a value that decreases as ``x`` and ``y`` move further away
in space from each other. Note that *further* here may account for cyclic behaviour in
the data, for example.

In this library, we often use kernels as a smoothing tool: given a dataset of distinct
points, we can reconstruct the underlying data generating distribution through smoothing
of the data with kernels.

Some kernels are parameterizable and may represent other well known kernels when given
appropriate parameter values. For example, the :class:`SquaredExponentialKernel`,

.. math::
    k(x,y) = \text{output_scale} * \exp (-||x-y||^2/2 * \text{length_scale}^2),
which if parameterized with an ``output_scale`` of
:math:`\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \,*\, \text{length_scale}}`, yields the well known
Gaussian kernel.

A :class:`~coreax.kernel.Kernel` must implement a
:meth:`~coreax.kernel.Kernel.compute_elementwise` method, which returns the floating
point value after evaluating the kernel on two floats, ``x`` and ``y``. Additional
methods, such as :meth:`Kernel.grad_x_elementwise`, can optionally be overridden to
improve performance. The canonical example is when a suitable closed-form representation
of a higher-order gradient can be used to avoid the expense of performing automatic
differentiation.

Such an example can be seen in :class:`SteinKernel`, where the analytic forms of
:meth:`Kernel.divergence_x_grad_y` are significantly cheaper to compute that the
automatic differentiated default.
