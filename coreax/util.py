"""
Functionality to perform simple, generic tasks and operations.

The functions within this module are simple solutions to various problems or
requirements that are sufficiently generic to be useful across multiple areas of the
codebase. Examples of this include computation of squared distances, definition of
class factories and checks for numerical precision.
