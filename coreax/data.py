"""
Classes for reading different structures of input data.

In order to calculate a coreset, :meth:`~coreax.reduction.Coreset.fit` requires an
instance of a subclass of :class:`DataReader`. It is necessary to use
:class:`DataReader` because :class:`~coreax.reduction.Coreset` requires a
two-dimensional :class:`~jax.Array`. Data reductions are performed along the first
dimension.

The user should read in their data files using their preferred library that returns a
:class:`jax.Array` or :func:`numpy.array`. This array is passed to a
:meth:`load() <DataReader.load>` method. The user should not normally invoke
:class:`DataReader` directly. The user should select an appropriate subclass
of :class:`DataReader` to match the structure of the input array. The
:meth:`load() <DataReader.load>` method on the subclass will rearrange the original data
into the required two-dimensional format.

Various post-processing methods may be implemented if applicable to visualise or
restore a calculated coreset to match the format of the original data. To save a
copy of a coreset, call :meth:`format() <DataReader.format>` on a subclass to return an
:class:`~jax.Array`, which can be passed to the chosen IO library to write a file.
