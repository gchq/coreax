"""
Classes for reading different structures of input data.

In order to calculate a coreset, an instance of a subclass of :class:`DataReader` is
passed to :class:`~coreax.ReductionStrategy`. It is necessary to use
:class:`DataReader` because :class:`~coreax.ReductionStrategy` requires a
two-dimensional :class:`~jax.Array`. Data reductions are performed along the first
dimension.

The user should read in their data files using their preferred library that returns a
:class:`jax.Array` or :class:`numpy.Array`. This array is passed to a
:meth:`DataReader.load` method. The user should not normally call
:meth:`DataReader.__init__` directly. The user should select an appropriate subclass
of :class:`DataReader` to match the structure of the input array. The :meth:`load`
method on the subclass will rearrange the original data into the required
two-dimensional format.

Various post-processing methods may be implemented if applicable to visualise or
restore a calculated coreset to match the format of the original data. To save a
copy of a coreset, call :meth:`format` to return an :class:`~jax.Array`, which can
be passed to the chosen IO library to write a file.
