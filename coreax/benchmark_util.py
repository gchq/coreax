Core functionality for setting up and managing coreset solvers.

This module provides functions to initialise solvers Kernel Thinning, Kernel Herding,
Stein Thinning, Random Sampling, and Randomised Cholesky. It also defines helper
functions for computing solver parameters and retrieving solver names.

    Calculate the delta parameter for kernel thinning.

    This function evaluates the following cases:

    1. If :math:`\\log n` is positive:
       - Further evaluates :math:`\\log (\\log n)`.
         * If this is also positive, returns :math:`\frac{1}{n} \\log (\\log n)`.
         * Otherwise, returns :math:`\frac{1}{n} \\log n`.
    2. If :math:`\\log n` is negative:
       - Returns :math:`\frac{1}{n}`.

    The recommended value is :math:`\frac{1}{n} \\log (\\log n)`, but for small
    values of :math:`n`, this may be negative or even undefined. Therefore,
    alternative values are used in such cases.
