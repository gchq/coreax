Example coreset generation using randomly generated point clouds and score matching.

This example showcases how a coreset can be generated from a dataset containing ``n``
points sampled from ``k`` clusters in space.

A coreset is generated using Stein kernel herding, with a PCIMQ base kernel. The score
function (gradient of the log-density function) for the Stein kernel is estimated by
applying kernel density estimation (KDE) to the data, and then taking gradients. The
initial coreset generated from this procedure is then weighted, with weights determined
such that the weighted coreset achieves a better maximum mean discrepancy when compared
to the original dataset than the unweighted coreset.

The coreset attained from Stein kernel herding is compared to a coreset generated via
uniform random sampling. Coreset quality is measured using maximum mean discrepancy
(MMD).
