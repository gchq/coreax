End-to-end example for using recombination solvers.

In this example we demonstrate how the recombination solvers in Coreax can be used to
find non-product Cubature formulae, given product Cubature formulae over the `n`-cube.
These formulae can be used to exactly (*up to finite-precision arithmetic*) integrate
all `n`-variate polynomials of, at most, some given degree `m`, over the `n`-cube.

    Run the 'recombination' example for finding non-product cubature formulae.

    Generates the non-product (recombined) cubature formulae over the `n`-cube, for all
    `n`-variate polynomials of maximal degree `m`, given a product Legendre-Gauss
    cubature formulae over the same domain with the same degree `m`.

    .. note::
        Cubature formulae are simply quadrature formulae for `n`-dimensional domains.
        However, it should be noted that many authors do not make this distinction and
        simply refer to all formulae as ``quadratures``.

    An `N`-point cubature formulae of degree `m`, with respect to some positive Borel
    measure :math:`\mu` on :math:`X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n`, is any discrete measure
    :math:`\mathbb{Q}^N := \sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i \delta_{x_i}`, with positive weights
    :math:`\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_+` and nodes :math:`x_i \in \text{supp}(X)`, for which
    the following equation

    .. math::
        \int_X f(x) d\mu(x) = \int_X f(x) d\mathbb{Q}^N(x):=\sum_{i=1}^N\lambda_i f(x_i)

    holds for all `n`-variate polynomials of degree `m`, :math:`f \in \mathcal{P}_m(X)`.

    For the purposes of computational efficiency, the number of points `N` in any given
    cubature formula should be minimal. Hence, recombination is used in this example to
    find a non-product formula with :math:`N_\text{recombination} \le N` points, where
    `N` is the number of points in the Legendre-Gauss product formula over the `n`-cube.
