"""
Benchmark time taken to generate coresets from a large dataset.

The benchmarking process follows these steps:
1. Start with the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60_000 training images and 10_000
   test images.
2. To reduce dimensionality, apply density preserving UMAP to project the 28x28 60_000
   images into 16 components before applying coreset algorithms.
3. Generate coresets of different sizes using various coreset algorithms and record the
   time taken.

The benchmark is run on amazon g4dn.12xlarge instance with 4 nvidia t4 tensor core
GPUs, 48 virtual CPUs and 192 GiB memory.
