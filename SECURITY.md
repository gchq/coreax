## Reporting a Vulnerability

Disclosures of vulnerabilities in Coreax are always welcomed. Whilst we aim to write
clean and secure code free from bugs, we recognise that this is an open source project,
relying on other of open source libraries that are modified and updated on a regular
basis. We hope that the community will continue to support us as we endeavour to
maintain and develop this tool together.

If you believe that you have identified a potential vulnerability in the code base,
please report this promptly to [oss@gchq.gov.uk](mailto:oss@gchq.gov.uk). Please describe the problem in as
much detail as possible, ideally with examples. Each report will be dealt with on a
case-by-case basis with clear. You will receive regular communication on the resolution
and progress of your report.
