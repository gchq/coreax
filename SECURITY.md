## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage all users of the Coreax repository to be security conscious in their
development practices and use.

If you believe that you have identified a potential vulnerability in the code base,
please report this promptly to [oss@gchq.gov.uk](mailto:oss@gchq.gov.uk).

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
